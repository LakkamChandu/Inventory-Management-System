## Overall Learning 

>Throughout my Java internship at SURETrust, I focused on solidifying my grasp of Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming principles. The experience provided me with practical opportunities to design logical solutions and implement core Java features effectively. I concentrated on writing code that is clean and easy to maintain while sharpening my debugging and problem-solving skills. Additionally, this journey gave me valuable insight into developing real-world applications and significantly improved my ability to document my work and collaborate professionally.

<!-- Project 1 -->

<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Console Based Calculator</h3>
<p>
This project involved designing a basic functional calculator that runs in the console.
It handles standard arithmetic operations and demonstrates core Java concepts like loops, conditional statements, and method creation.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<!-- Project 2 -->

<h3 id="project2">Project 2: Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p>
This project expanded on logic building by creating the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
It required implementing game rules, handling user input validation, and checking win conditions using 2D arrays.

</p>

<!-- Project 3 -->

<h3 id="project3">Project 3: Movie Ticket Booking System</h3>
<p>
This was an intermediate project focused on system design.
It involved managing movie listings, seat selection logic, and booking confirmations, introducing concepts of data management and object relationships.

</p>

<!-- Project 4 (Major Project) -->

<h3 id="project4">Project 4:Inventory Management System (Major Project)</h3>
<p>
The final capstone project showcased the practical application of all advanced concepts learned throughout the course.

It is a secure, API-driven backend solution designed to digitize inventory operations for small businesses.
It moves beyond simple tracking to offer a complete "Procurement to Pay" audit trail.
</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> Implemented a 2-step verification process with Email OTPs and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless security.</li>
<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> Distinct roles for Admins (Owners) and Users (Employees) to ensure data safety.</li>
<li><strong>Procurement Lifecycle:</strong> A complex logic flow connecting Suppliers, Purchase Orders, and Goods Receipts to automatically update stock levels.</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> A background scheduler that runs nightly to check for low stock and trigger alerts.</li>
</ul>
